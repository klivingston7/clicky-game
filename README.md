# Clicky Game

This app is a front-end game built with React.js. 

## How it works
* The user begins the game by clicking on a Pusheen
* The goal of the game is to click each Pusheen only once
* After each click, React will shuffle the cards using an NPM package called Shuffle-Array and update how many you have correctly guessed
* Each Pusheen tracks how many times it has been clicked, and if it has been clicked twice, the game will end
* Upon game end, the app will update your highest score and reset the Pusheen counts

## Technologies used
* React JS

## Limitations
* Currently does not work.
